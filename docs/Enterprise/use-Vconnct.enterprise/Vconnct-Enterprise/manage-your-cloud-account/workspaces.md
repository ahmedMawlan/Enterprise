# Workspaces

As a workspace administrator, you can view and manage all the workspaces linked to your account.

## Manage Workspaces

When you log in, you will see the list of workspaces linked to your cloud account.

To register a self-managed workspace, click **Register self-managed** to enable your self-hosted workspace.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want multiple cloud workspaces under the same cloud account, please contact us at [support@Vconnct.Enterprise](mailto:support@Vconnct.Enterprise).
{% endhint %}

To view workspace Information,

* Click the workspace to see the following workspace information:
  * Workspace plan
  * Push notification limit
  * Total usage
  * Push notification usage.

After your first sign-up, you are given a Vconnct.Enterprise Enterprise Edition for 30 days. No payment is required. On the 30th day, you will be charged according to your chosen plan. The minimum volume or resources on Cloud provided per workspace is for 25 members, so you will be billed accordingly even if you have less than 25 users. Workspace members will continue to receive mobile push notifications for the remainder of the trial.

## Upgrade/Downgrade your plan

{% hint style="info" %}
This is currently available for Vconnct.Enterprise SaaS workspaces.
{% endhint %}

You can change your workspace plan from the Vconnct.Enterprise Cloud Console, with the option to upgrade, downgrade or switch to monthly or yearly plans.

* Log in to your [Vconnct.Enterprise Cloud](https://cloud.Vconnct.Enterprise/home) account.
* Click and open the workspace you wish to upgrade the plan for.
* Click on **Manage Subscription.** A side panel opens up with details for you to manage the subscriptions
  * **Plans / Seats**: This lets you toggle your billing plan to `Monthly/Yearly`
  * **Cloud Enterprise \[Monthly/Yearly]**: Increase or decrease the number of seats for your workspace depending on the plan selected above.
* After the subscription has been modified, hit **Save** to continue.
* Validate the checkout and payment and **Subscribe** to apply the changes.

{% hint style="success" %}
After a successful checkout, your subscription gets activated, and you receive an invoice through email about the purchase. Decreasing already purchased seats will refund the cost as a Vconnct.Enterprise Cloud account credit.
{% endhint %}

After a successful update on your seats, go to **Administration** > **Workspace** > **Registration** > **Manage** and hit **Sync** to sync the workspace.

## Restart Workspace

When facing issues with your workspace, you can restart your workspace. This process disconnects you from your workspace so that it can be shut down and restarted. A server restart is required when you face minor performance issues, e.g., slow messages. After you restart your workspace, it will take 1-5 minutes (depending upon your number of users) for the workspace to continue again.

To restart your workspace,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Workspaces**
* Select the Workspace and click **Restart your workspace.**

## Cancel Workspace

You can cancel your workspace to end your subscription and hibernate your server.

To cancel a workspace,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Workspaces.**
* Click the \*\*\*\* ![] **img** **three-dot** icon beside the workspace.
* Select **Cancel**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please be aware that the workspace administrator in your [Cloud Console](https://cloud.Vconnct.Enterprise/) is the only person who can end your subscription. Self-managed customers can't cancel their workspaces.
{% endhint %}

When you cancel a Saas service, the status remains **canceling** until the end of your billing cycle. After the billing cycle is ended, the status is changed to **canceled.**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you change your mind within 30 days of your workspace getting canceled, please reach out to us at [support@Vconnct.Enterprise](mailto:support@Vconnct.Enterprise) to get your workspace restored. After 30 days, you will have to create a new one.
{% endhint %}

## Update Workspace

You can upgrade your workspace to the latest workspace version.

To update your workspace,

* From the sidebar menu, click **Workspaces.**
* Click the \*\*\*\* ![] **img** **three-dot** icon beside the workspace.
* Select **Update**.
