# Create your new cloud account

Vconnct.Enterprise Cloud allows you to connect your self-hosted Vconnct.Enterprise workspace to the services we provide in our Cloud. It enables you to manage your workspace better. You can explore the workspace capabilities for free by signing up for a [30-day Vconnct.Enterprise Enterprise Edition Trial](../../setup-and-configure/enterprise-edition-trial/). You will get a notification in advance of when the trial is coming to an end. If you purchase any plan, your trial version will automatically convert to a paid plan at the end of the trial period.

If you are a self-managed customer**,** a cloud account is optional, but if you are a SaaS customer, it is created by default when you first start your workspace with us.
