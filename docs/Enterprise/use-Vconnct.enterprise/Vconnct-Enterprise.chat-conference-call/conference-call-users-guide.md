# Conference Call User's Guide

{% hint style="info" %}
Contact your workspace administrator or follow [conference-call-admin-guide](conference-call-admin-guide/ "mention") to configure conference calls in your workspace.
{% endhint %}

In Vconnct.Enterprise, you can initiate video and audio conferences using your desired provider in any [room](../user-guides/rooms/).

## Initiating a call - Direct Message


To start a call in Direct Message,

* Click on the **phone** icon from the room's header. You may have pre-flight options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. However, these options depend on the conference call provider you have selected.
* Click the **call** button. The pop-up changes to the “calling state”. Now, you can perform other actions while you wait for the receiver to answer. The ringer stays active for 30 seconds. After that **Call again** button appears in the room.

## Incoming direct call


Three things happen once you receive a call:

* A pop-up appears wherever you are in the Vconnct.Enterprise application.
* The incoming call ringer starts to ring.
* An incoming call item will be highlighted in the left sidebar.

These options are available when you have an incoming call:

* Accept and join the call room.
* Decline and give the other user feedback through the chat.
* Dismiss and silently ignore the call.

## Start a call - Room

You can also start a call in other rooms like Team, Channel, Discussion, and Multiple Direct Messages.

To start a call in a room,

* Click on the **phone** icon from the room's header. You may have pre-flight options like turning on/off the camera or microphone. However, these options depend on the conference call provider you have selected.
* Click the **call** button. A message is sent in the room, where all participants in the call are shown as thumbnails.

{% hint style="info" %}
The ringing feature is unavailable in any room except **Direct Messages(DMs**).
{% endhint %}

## Conference logs

After a conference call is ended, the room keeps a record of the following:

* The user who initiated it
* The start time
* The name of the conference
* The attendees
