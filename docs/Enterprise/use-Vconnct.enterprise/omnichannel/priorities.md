# Priorities


OmniChannel Priorities helps you streamline conversations coming through multiple queues to prioritize them and enhance productivity. It is helpful for [agents](agents.md) to determine the conversations they should prioritize when responding to customers. The omnichannel queue contains chats with and without priorities because they are not assigned by default.

To configure **Priorities** in your workspace,

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Omnichannel > Queue Management**.
* Under the **sorting mechanism**, select **priorities.** Click **Save Changes**.
* Navigate to **Administration > Omnichannel > Priorities**. It lists the default priorities: **Highest**, **High**, **Medium**, **Low,** and **Lowest**.
* Select a priority to edit it and customize the name.
* Click **Reset** to return the name of all the priorities back to default.

## Change the Priority of a chat

To manually change the priority of a conversation,

* Hover over the chat and click the **kebab** menu. Select the **priority** option you want to assign to that chat.
* After the priority is updated, the chat is moved to reflect its priority position in the [queue](../omnichannel-agents-guides/omnichannel-queue.md). For example, a chat with the priority '**highest**" is transferred to the top of the chat queue.
* You can also change the priority of a chat from the **Edit room** tab of the chat by navigating to **Room Information > Edit**.

Organizations can benefit from automation using chatbots to determine the priority of each conversation based on the nature of its contents.

## Filter Omnichannel chats by Priorities

As an Omnichannel [manager](managers.md), you can filter the chats based on their priorities. You can join or forward a high-priority chat to follow up and ensure they are resolved on time.

To filter chats based on priorities,

* Navigate to **Administration > Omnichannel > Current Chats**.
* You can preview the priority of each chat from this table.
