# SLA Policies


Omnichannel SLA Policies allow you to change the order of Omnichannel queues based on **Estimated Wait Time**. It means chats with a shorter wait time will appear in the queue before others with longer or no due time set. SLA Policies are not mandatory for each chat. Thus, the Omnichannel queue has conversations with and without SLA policies.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Estimated Wait Time** is the time defined for a customer to be served. For example, if the estimated wait time is 10 minutes, the customer is supposed to wait in queue for up to 10 minutes until an agent takes the chat.
{% endhint %}

To configure **SLA Policies** in your workspace,

* Navigate to **Administration > Workspace > Settings > Omnichannel > Queue Management**.
* Under the **sorting mechanism**, select **SLA Policies.** Click **Save Changes**.
