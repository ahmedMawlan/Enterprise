# Omnichannel Contact Manager Assignment


â€‹This feature lets you assign an omnichannel contact to a dedicated Omnichannel agent. If this contact initiates a conversation and the dedicated agent is **available**, the chat is routed directly to them. Otherwise, it will be routed to any other agent based on the routing algorithm selected.

{% hint style="info" %}
To enable this feature, you need to enable **Assign new conversations to the contact manager** by changing the setting under **Administration** -> **Workspace** -> **Settings** -> **Omnichannel** -> **Routing** or contact your workspace administrator.
{% endhint %}
