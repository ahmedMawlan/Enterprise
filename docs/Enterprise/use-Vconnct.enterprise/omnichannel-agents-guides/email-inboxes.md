# Email Inboxes

In your Vconnct.Enterprise workspace, you can receive emails from contacts on an email address configured as an [email inbox](../workspace-administration/email-inboxes.md).

{% hint style="info" %}
To use this feature, your workspace administrator must enable [Omnichannel ](../omnichannel/)and assign [agents](../omnichannel/agents.md) and [managers](../omnichannel/managers.md). Kindly contact your administrator to set up [email inboxes ](../workspace-administration/email-inboxes.md)on your workspace.
{% endhint %}

Once an [email inbox ](../workspace-administration/email-inboxes.md)is set up successfully, any new email received is shown in your Vconnct.Enterprise workspace. You can view and reply to these emails from your workspace. When you reply, it appears like any other email in your contactâ€™s inbox.&#x20;

When you log in to your workspace as an agent and [set your status to **Available**](./#omnichannel-agent-availability)**,** to handle new conversations:

* Any new email initiated to the [department](../omnichannel/departments.md) you belong to appears under **Chats in Progress**
* Click on an email to reply to the omnichannel contact.

### Reply Email Inbox Messages

* As soon as your contact sends an email, it will appear under **Chats in Progress.**
* Click the chat to open it. Click **Reply via Email,** type your message, and click **Send.** Your contact receives the reply in their email.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you type without clicking **Reply via Email**, your contact will **NOT** receive your reply at all.
{% endhint %}

## Invite an Agent to an Email Inbox

Suppose you need help with a particular email, you can invite your fellow **agent** to that channel using `/invite @username` .

Once an agent is invited to an email inbox, they have access to all the previous conversations that have taken place there. You can also have internal conversations with your fellow agent on the same channel.
