Lastly, Vconnct.Enterprise needs an AMI connection to be able to read your Asterisk configuration and connect extensions to RC users.

So, navigate to the **Settings > Asterisk Manager Users** menu. Here you can create a user to be used by Vconnct.Enterprise and limit the access of this user only to the IP address or network where your Vconnct.Enterprise is.
