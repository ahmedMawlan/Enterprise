## Registering an account

To access any Vconnct.Enterprise workspace or register an account manually or use one of the many supported OAuth services (if the desired workspace has enabled these services), after successfully registering, you can log in to the workspace.

### Manual Registration

You can create an account by providing your:

* Name
* Email
* Password
* Reason to join

A workspace can ask you to verify your email. You can do this by simply clicking on the link sent to the registered email.

Workspaces can be configured to use custom parameters. Therefore each Vconnct.Enterprise workspaces might ask for different information or restrict registration based on the rules set by the workspace. You can contact your workspace administrator if you are unsure how to register your account.

### OAuth Registration

If your workspace has configured OAuth services (i.e., GitHub or Google), use the account credentials for that supported service to register into the workspace.

### Choosing a username and display name

After you have successfully registered your account, you can choose your username. Your username is your unique identifier for others to use to direct message or mention you.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Your username is separate from your display name on the workspace.
{% endhint %}

Usernames on each Vconnct.Enterprise workspace must be unique to that workspace. However, display names can repeat on the same workspace. For example, there can be only one user with the username:`johnsmith`, but there can be more than one user with the display name :`John Smith`.
