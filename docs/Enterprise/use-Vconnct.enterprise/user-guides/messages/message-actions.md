# Message Actions

**Message actions** allow you to interact with messages that you've already posted.

## Open message actions

To open the message actions menu, place your mouse over the message and click the **Actions** menu on the left.

## Quote a message

Click **img** to respond to another user's message without notifying the user directly. Select **Quote** in the message actions menu.

### Edit messages

To edit a message, click on the **Edit** option on the message actions menu. You can also place your cursor in the message box and press the **Up arrow** to edit your last message.

_The administrator of the Vconnct.Enterprise server sets the permissions for who can edit messages from other users. By default, only administrators, moderators, and channel owners can edit messages from other users._

### Draft messages

Vconnct.Enterprise saves drafts of all message edits so you can return to edit later. When drafting a message, press **Escape** to discard the draft.

### Delete messages

To delete a message, click **Delete** in the message actions menu.

### Star messages

Star messages to make the message easier to find it later. To star a message, click **Star** in the message actions menu. If you want to remove the star from an already starred message, click **Remove Star**.

Find starred messages by going to the channel actions menu and clicking **Starred Messages**.

Starred messages are per chat room and are not global; each room has its list of starred messages.

### Pin messages

Pin a message to a channel to make that message easily accessible to all users on the channel. To pin a message, select the **Pin Message** option in the message actions menu. Remove already pinned messages by selecting **Remove Pin**.

_The administrator of a Vconnct.Enterprise team sets the permissions for who can pin messages in a channel. By default, only administrators, moderators, and owners of the channel can pin messages._

### Reactions

You can react to messages with emojis.

To add a reaction to a message, go to the message, click on the **Smiley Face** icon on the right of the message, and then choose an emoji.

You can see other usersâ€™ emoji reactions beneath the message. To react with the same emoji as another user, click the emoji. You can also remove your reaction by clicking on your emoji.

### Permalink a message

Permalink a message to create a URL directly to that message in the chat.

Click on the **Permalink** option in the message actions menu. This copies the message into your clipboard.

### Copy a message

To copy the contents of a message to your clipboard, click on the `copy` option on the message actions menu.

## Reply to a message

Reply to a message to quote a message from another user. The reply automatically triggers a notification sent to the message's original author.

There are two options for replies:

Use **Reply in Thread** to start a new thread underneath the original message. Threads create a string of messages that quote the original. Use **Reply in Direct Message** to quote the original message in a direct message to that user.

## Message Info


The message info shows a list of users that have read the message with a timestamp.

## Message Forwarding/Share message &#x20;

Click **img** to forward messages to another channel, thread, or discussion.&#x20;

You can forward messages directly to any user, channel, thread, or discussion where you have access to send messages. You can select a message and share it with unlimited recipients.  It saves time by eliminating the need to send individual messages and ensures everyone is on the same page by sharing messages with multiple users in one go. This feature is particularly valuable for efficiently sharing important information through different channels and engaging with a larger audience. It offers benefits such as time efficiency, streamlined communication, enhanced collaboration, and convenience.

{% hint style="info" %}
Message sharing is available from version 6.2 and above.
